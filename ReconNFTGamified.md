# Gamified Recon NFT

The [Recon NFT](https://medium.com/@convexlabs/this-nft-logs-your-ip-address-7f6f9cf2376e) unlocks executing JavaScript in the browser of the NFT viewer.

This could be an opportunity to:
- Unlockable NFTs: include a minimal JavaScript game (Snake, 2048...) to be played/beaten before the NFT shows up.
- Best Score NFTs: NFTs owned by the holder of the highest score in a game and that reflects their username/message. It would be awesome if the game is played in the NFT itself, but this may hit limitations of the browser at different levels. In that case, the game itself can be played in a third-party server.
- FlagNFTs: NFTs that need to be captured by resolving a flag. These can be challenges in web security, steganography of the image of the NFT... or simple challenges such as "the first person to view this NFT from a Tor endpoints owns the NFT"
